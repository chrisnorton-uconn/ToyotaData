# ToyotaData
28 time series data from power converters. I would like to see how your feature extraction and classification works. Using different ML techniques for time series classification. I would like to try these techniques on the Toyota datasets.  There are 3 Toyota datasets named as 'Continuous', 'Datasets 1,2,3' and 'MG Data', one dataset from Hardware group named 'HIL Data'.
